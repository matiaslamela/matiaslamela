### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Technology, architecture, and design are my passions. All design must be intuitive, beautiful, and harmonious; it's about understanding what people want and create something amazing.

I am interested in developing all kinds of projects, from web pages, apps, and even buildings. I wrote my first line of code in C # in a contest at UnLaM when I was 17 years old, I always kept updated of new technologies. I am fascinated by the divide and conquer strategy and the scientific method, especially Popper's falsificationism.

React adjusts to my way of being, creating a SPA from my designs in Photoshop, Illustrator, or Adobe XD, from components, in an orderly manner, easy to maintain and update.

I want to be able to learn about agile methodologies so that I can start my own company in the future. I am interested in home automation and sustainable architecture. The best way to achieve this is to learn in companies that apply these methodologies.

Skills: React, Bootstrap, Redux, Javascript(ES6), Sqlite, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, HTML, Photoshop, Illustrator, Adobe XD, CSS, AutoCAD, Revit, 3Ds Max, V-ray, TwinMotion. 

i'm currently a teaching assistant at henry. Helping during lectures and workshops, explaining core concepts of JavaScript and other technologies used for web development.
